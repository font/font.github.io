I'm a passionate Linux advocate who loves all things open source. As a more
formal title I'm an Open Source Software Engineer and I'm currently working for
Red Hat, Inc. I am from Argentina and obtained a computer science background
from the University of California, Davis. In my spare time I enjoy many things
such as: tinkering with technology e.g. software projects, embedded devices,
sysadmin work, etc.; watching and playing soccer; working on automobiles with
respect to performance improvements and maintenance; lastly cooking. Below are
some ways to get in contact with me:
